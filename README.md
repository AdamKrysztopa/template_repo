# Python Template Repository

This template repository provides a ready-to-use Python development environment leveraging Docker and VS Code Dev Containers.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Code Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables on your system before proceeding:

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
export GIT_USER_NAME="Your Git Username"
export GIT_USER_EMAIL="Your Git Email"
```

Optionally, you can add them to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or similar:

```bash
echo 'export GIT_USER_NAME="Your Git Username"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GIT_USER_EMAIL="Your Git Email"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## How to Use this Template

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Create Repository from Template**:
   - Go to the [template repository](https://github.com/AdamKrysztopa/template_repo).
   - Click the "Use this template" button and create your own repository.

2. **Clone Your New Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git
cd your-new-repo
```

3. **Open in VS Code with Dev Containers**:
   - Ensure Docker is running.
   - Open VS Code, use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

4. **Initial Setup (Automatic)**:
   - On creating your first branch, GitHub Actions will automatically run a renaming script to customize your repository.
   - No manual interaction is needed at this stage.
